# Restaurant-recommended-system-using-Machine-learning
Developed a restaurant recommendation system based on latitude and longitude.

## What does this project entails?

Recommender system has the ability to predict whether a partiular prefer an item or not based on the user's profile. Recommender  system are beneficial to both service providers and users.

In this project I am building a recommendation system that will recommend us restaurants in a particular destination taking in your latitude and longitude geogrophic location.

## Details of the project

we will be taking in dataset and train our model according to reviews it has and its location, using  Kmeans clustering.
We will also see how to potray geogrophical data onto our colab file using plotly libraries( and geopandas) and more.
Lastly we will build a basic function that will take geogrophical data as input and recommend restaurants to the user
